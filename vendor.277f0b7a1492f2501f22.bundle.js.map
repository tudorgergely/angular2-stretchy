Each View can contain many View Containers.\n * <!-- /TODO -->\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Given this template...\n *\n * ```\n * Count: {{items.length}}\n * <ul>\n *   <li *ngFor=\"let  item of items\">{{item}}</li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * We have two {\\@link TemplateRef}s:\n *\n * Outer {\\@link TemplateRef}:\n * ```\n * Count: {{items.length}}\n * <ul>\n *   <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\"></template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Inner {\\@link TemplateRef}:\n * ```\n *   <li>{{item}}</li>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that the original template is broken down into two separate {\\@link TemplateRef}s.\n *\n * The outer/inner {\\@link TemplateRef}s are then assembled into views like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <!-- ViewRef: outer-0 -->\n * Count: 2\n * <ul>\n *   <template view-container-ref></template>\n *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-1 --><li>first</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-1 -->\n *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-2 --><li>second</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-2 -->\n * </ul>\n * <!-- /ViewRef: outer-0 -->\n * ```\n * \\@experimental\n * @abstract\n */\nvar EmbeddedViewRef = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(EmbeddedViewRef, _super);\n    function EmbeddedViewRef() {\n        _super.apply(this, arguments);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @abstract\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    EmbeddedViewRef.prototype.context = function () { };\n    /**\n     * @abstract\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    EmbeddedViewRef.prototype.rootNodes = function () { };\n    return EmbeddedViewRef;\n}(ViewRef));\nvar ViewRef_ = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _view\n     * @param {?} animationQueue\n     */\n    function ViewRef_(_view, animationQueue) {\n        this._view = _view;\n        this.animationQueue = animationQueue;\n        this._view = _view;\n        this._originalMode = this._view.cdMode;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(ViewRef_.prototype, \"internalView\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._view; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(ViewRef_.prototype, \"rootNodes\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._view.flatRootNodes; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(ViewRef_.prototype, \"context\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._view.context; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(ViewRef_.prototype, \"destroyed\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._view.destroyed; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.markForCheck = function () { this._view.markPathToRootAsCheckOnce(); };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.detach = function () { this._view.cdMode = __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__change_detection_constants__[\"b\" /* ChangeDetectorStatus */].Detached; };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.detectChanges = function () {\n        this._view.detectChanges(false);\n        this.animationQueue.flush();\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.checkNoChanges = function () { this._view.detectChanges(true); };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.reattach = function () {\n        this._view.cdMode = this._originalMode;\n        this.markForCheck();\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} callback\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.onDestroy = function (callback) {\n        if (!this._view.disposables) {\n            this._view.disposables = [];\n        }\n        this._view.disposables.push(callback);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.destroy = function () { this._view.detachAndDestroy(); };\n    return ViewRef_;\n}());\nfunction ViewRef__tsickle_Closure_declarations() {\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @type {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype._originalMode;\n    /** @type {?} */\n    ViewRef_.prototype._view;\n    /** @type {?} */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.animationQueue;\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=view_ref.js.map\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"0eQJ\":\n/***/ (function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\n/* harmony import */ var __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__ = __webpack_require__(\"Rw+2\");\n/* unused harmony export VERSION */\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

The sanitizer leaves safe values intact.\n *\n * \\@security Calling any of the `bypassSecurityTrust...` APIs disables Angular's built-in\n * sanitization for the value passed in.

This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common,\n * the `transition` function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which\n * are aliases for the `void => *` and `* => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    var /** @type {?} */ animationData = Array.isArray(steps) ? new AnimationSequenceMetadata(steps) : steps;\n    return new AnimationStateTransitionMetadata(stateChangeExpr, animationData);\n}\n/**\n * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run.

Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n * used within {\\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\\@link group group}, or {\\@link transition\n * transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n * delay and easing values.

The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run.
